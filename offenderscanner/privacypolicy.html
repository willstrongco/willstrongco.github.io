            <p>
                Offender Scanner (“we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (the “Application”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.
            </p>

            <p>
                We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
            </p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.
                
                This Privacy Policy was created using Termly’s Privacy Policy Generator.

            <h2 class="content-subhead">COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:
            </p>

            <h3>Geo-Location Information</h3>
            <p>
                We may request access or permission to and track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using the Application, to provide location-based services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Application to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find information about sex offenders registered nearby you.</li>
                <li>Increase the efficiency and operation of the Application.</li>
                <li>Find information about specific location you ask</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:
            </p>

            <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
            <p>
                If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
            </p>

            <h3>Third-Party Advertisers</h3>
            <p>
                We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Application. These companies may use information about your visits to the Application and other websites that are contained in web cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content_subhead">SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content_subhead">POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h2>
            <p>
                We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content_subhead">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content_subhead">CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
